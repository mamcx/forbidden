# Rust : Forbidden

> An experimental auth library for Rust applications

### Goals

This crate is to define a common set of traits and idioms to provide for most applications with a way to incorporate authentication.

Is **NOT** the place to put the specific implementations for web/OS/etc.

## Warning

This is an experimental project, without members with experience in security.

I hope to put the "ball to move" so finally Rust has a decent auth system to rely on.

## üî¨ Research

These libraries and articles are used as inspiration:

* [13 best practices for user account, authentication, and password management, 2021 edition](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/account-authentication-and-password-management-best-practices)
